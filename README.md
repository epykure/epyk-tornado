### Epyk Tornado!


An easy way to use Epyk within a Tornado Web App


Presentation
================================
This package will make a simple interface between the back and the front end generation.

Epyk can be used in two different ways:

1. Generating Jinja template which will then be updated by Tornado
2. Producing on the fly template within the views

This project will provide example on the two ways of using it.

Do not hesitate to propose new examples !
